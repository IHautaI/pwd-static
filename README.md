Parsing With Derivatives
Alternate version

This version of parsing with derivatives uses a static language representation.  The 
derivative is implemented as a search rather than generating new nodes in the language.
This allows the nullability of all nodes to be precalculated.

Current version is a recognizer, full parser to come.

This project was inspired by playing with parsing with derivatives in C++, and 
making some observations through multiple failures.
